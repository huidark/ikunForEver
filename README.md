# Fitness App
## Introduction
In modern society, people are paying more and more attention to the topic of exercise. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 19.3 percent of the U.S. population was engaged in sports and exercise each day in 2019. With such an enormous demand, many mobile apps with exercise themes have emerged in the market. However, at the same time, we have also identified some common problems with them. For example, most existing APPs have redundant functions, and it is difficult to find an application similar to a calendar that can help you record and track your fitness status. Also, most APP use in-APP Subscription systems, which inadvertently add barriers to first-time fitness app users.

To address these issues, we decided to develop our Fitness Calendar Android APP. The features of our APP include taking photos of each training session, helping users to plan their training schedule and tasks, and reminding them to train according to the schedule. Our target market is aimed at people who are new to training with rare experience, users who want to plan their training schedule better, and potential users who are interested in fitness. 

Our mission is to empower users to take control of their health and fitness by providing them with a comprehensive and user-friendly APP. With our APP, users can plan and track their workouts' progress easily. Our app is designed to inspire and motivate users to achieve their fitness goals through our personalized training plans, progress tracking, and reminder functions.
